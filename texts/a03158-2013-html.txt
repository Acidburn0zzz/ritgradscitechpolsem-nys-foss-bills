BILL NUMBER:A3158

TITLE OF BILL:  An act to amend the tax law, in relation to providing a
tax credit to individuals for up to two hundred dollars of expenses
related to the development and posting of an open source or free license
program

PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:  The purpose of this bill is to incen-
tivize individuals to develop open source software with a tax credit.

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:

*Section gg(1) amends S 606 of the Tax Law by providing for an open
source tax credit to the creators of open source software.

*Section gg(2) amends S 606 of the Tax Law by providing for the type of
programs that qualify for the open source tax credit.

*Section gg(3) amends S 606 of the Tax Law by providing to whom the open
source tax credit applies.

*Section gg(4) amends S 606 of the Tax Law by providing the limits and
regulations of the tax credit itself

JUSTIFICATION:

"Open source" refers to software that is available to be downloaded by
users free of charge, along with its source code. Anyone who uses
an.open source program can modify and redistribute the program freely.
By allowing open access to source code, open source software enhances a
broader dissemination of knowledge and ideas. Currently, corporations
and self-employed individuals who write open source programs are eligi-
ble for a tax deduction for their costs. However, most open source soft-
ware is written by individuals who don't qualify for this tax credit.
This legislation corrects this by creating a new tax credit that applies

to the out-of-pocket expenses incurred when writing software.
