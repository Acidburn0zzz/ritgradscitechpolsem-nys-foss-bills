A08831 Memo:
BILL NUMBER:A8831

TITLE OF BILL:
An act
to amend the tax law, in relation to providing a tax credit to
individuals for up to two hundred dollars of expenses related to the
development and posting of an open source or free license program

PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL: The purpose of this
bill is to incentive
individuals to develop Open Source Software with a tax credit.

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS: Section gg(1) amends
S 606 of the Tax
Law by providing for an Open Source tax credit to the creators of
Open Source software. Section gg(2) amends S 606 of the Tax Law by
providing for the type of programs that qualify for the Open Source
tax credit. Section gg(3) amends S 606 of the Tax Law by providing to
whom the Open Source tax credit applies. Section gg(4) amends S 606
of the Tax Law by providing the limits and regulations of the tax
credit itself

JUSTIFICATION:
T"Open Source" refers to software offered for free
online download along with its instruction set ("source code"). The
New York State Assembly currently uses Open Source programs such as
Mozilla for email, Firefox for web browsing, and WebCal for
electronic calendars. The Assembly's use of this software has led to
significant cost savings for the Assembly's operating budget. Once an
Open Source program is downloaded with its source code, anyone can
view the instructions, modify the program, and redistribute it with
the same freedoms. A 2006 report authored by John Irons and Carl
Malamud from the Center for American Progress details how Open Source
software provides a high social value amongst the group, but a
relatively low economic incentive for individual developers. By

allowing open access to the technology's source code, Open Source
software enhances a broader dissemination of knowledge and ideas.
Although large corporations such as IBM develop and use Open Source
programs, most Open Source software is written by individuals
volunteering from home. Currently, corporations and self-employed
individuals who create Open Source technology are eligible for a tax
deduction for their software development costs. The vast
majority of Open Source software creators (individual volunteers),
however, do not receive this tax credit. This legislation creates a
similar tax credit incentive for individuals who currently have no
means to deduct these expenses. The tax credit would apply only to
out-of-pocket expenses such as Internet hosting and depreciated cost
of capital expenses such as computers and education. The increased
incentive for individuals would attract more Open Source developers
to New York State, resulting in job creation and a reinvigoration of
our State's technology sector. Additionally, an influx of Open Source

software would lower operating costs for larger agencies (such as the
Assembly), by providing usable software without charge.
