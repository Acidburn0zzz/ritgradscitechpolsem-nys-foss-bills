Should the Government endorse or promote Free/Open Source Software
Development?

        Support Sellers (otherwise known as "Give Away the Recipe, Open A
        Restaurant"):
            In this model, you (effectively) give away the software product,
            but sell distribution, branding, and after-sale service. This is
            what (for example) Red Hat does.
        Loss Leader:
            In this model, you give away open-source as a loss-leader and
            market positioner for closed software. This is what Netscape is
            doing (who would eventually became Mozilla)
        Widget Frosting: 
            In this model, a hardware company (for which software is a
            necessary adjunct but strictly a cost rather than profit center)
            goes open-source in order to get better drivers and interface tools
            cheaper. Silicon Graphics, for example, supports and ships Samba.
        Accessorizing:
            Selling accessories - books, compatible hardware, complete systems
            with open-source software pre-installed. It's easy to trivialize
            this (open-source T-shirts, coffee mugs, Linux penguin dolls) but
            at least the books and hardware underly some clear successes:
            O'Reilly Associates, and SSC are among them.

Why Gov't Should be involved:
    Improves quality of all software, including proprietary
    supports under-invested and spill-over technology
    provides analogous support to small-biz type enterprises (individual
    developers don't have access to same tax relief vehicles as large companies
    i.e. R&D tax credit)
    Other nationstates, such as China and Korea, have even developed their own
    linux distributions:

    From a security perspective, projects like SELinux were developed in
    public/private partnerships. SELinux is used for protecting classified
    information, and is 'military grade' technology that only improves as more
    people test it and audit the source code.
    Bridging the digital divide
        By offering affordable software, improves access to information,
        vocation training, supplements public educational resources.
