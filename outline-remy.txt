Development?

        Support Sellers (otherwise known as "Give Away the Recipe, Open A
        Restaurant"):
            In this model, you (effectively) give away the software product,
            but sell distribution, branding, and after-sale service. This is
            what (for example) Red Hat does.
        Loss Leader:
            In this model, you give away open-source as a loss-leader and
            market positioner for closed software. This is what Netscape is
            doing (who would eventually became Mozilla)
        Widget Frosting: 
            In this model, a hardware company (for which software is a
            necessary adjunct but strictly a cost rather than profit center)
            goes open-source in order to get better drivers and interface tools
            cheaper. Silicon Graphics, for example, supports and ships Samba.
        Accessorizing:
            Selling accessories - books, compatible hardware, complete systems
            with open-source software pre-installed. It's easy to trivialize
            this (open-source T-shirts, coffee mugs, Linux penguin dolls) but
            at least the books and hardware underly some clear successes:
            O'Reilly Associates, and SSC are among them.
